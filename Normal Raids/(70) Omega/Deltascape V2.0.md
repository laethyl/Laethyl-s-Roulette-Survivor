# Deltascape: V1.0

##### Catastrophe

- EARTHQUAKE - Use Duty Action
- AETHERICAL RIFT  - Use Duty Action
  - The whole arena turns dark
- Ensure all are levitated or not when stakcup marker comes
- Stay away from tentacles with glowing markers
- PETROSPHERES - Use Duty Action when it is done without POTENT
- POTENT - Collapse to absolute dead center OR edge, depending on pattern IF coupled with PETROSPHERES
  - Otherwise, simply avoid levitating - very often you'll need to levitate immediately after, however
- Boss has a gaze
