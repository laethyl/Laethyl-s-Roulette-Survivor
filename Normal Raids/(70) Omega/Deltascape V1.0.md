##### Alte Roite

- Stay away from orange balls
  - They explode in the order they appear
- Huddle near boss when it goes to the edge
  - It blows balls away from it
- Spread out when platform begins to freeze, it will be too hard to move later
- Avoid temptation to skate on ice to spread purple markers
  - Ice disappears before they go off
- DOWNBURST - Run away from boss, finding a safe spot between fireballs
