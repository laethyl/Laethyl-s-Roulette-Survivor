# Asphodelos: The Second Circle

##### Hippokampos

- Be in a corner on the opposite side of the room from the RED arrow
  - This happens when boss's head splits from its body:
    - Half-room cleave in the direction of the RED arrow
    - Room-length column in the direction of the YELLOW arror
- SEWAGE DELUGE - Stand on platforms/grates when the room floods
- Find a red triangle friend when you get one
- Watch the edges, don't be in front of the head that appears
