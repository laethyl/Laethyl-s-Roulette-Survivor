# Matoya's Relict

##### MUDMAN

- Tethered balls will dart toward you. Line yourself up with holes on the edges
  - Later, holes will sometimes have dudes in them. Don't feed your balls to them!

##### NIXIE

- Non-tanks: Avoid tank's blue tethers
- SHOWER POWER - Avoid blue-lit pipes, 3/4 pipes on the edge will light up
- When waterspouts form, stand in the one closest to the front
  - This will blow you up to the cloud, kill the adds there
  - When boss is present, avoid the spouts

##### MOTHER PORXIE

- HUFF AND PUFF - Huddle onto the boss and angle yourself to get blown into the safe zone
- BARBEQUE - Be on the opposite edge of the map from the boss. Should you get sucked in, you die.
- When you get knocked in the air, you'll have a moment to see the direction of the arrows for HUFF AND PUFF
