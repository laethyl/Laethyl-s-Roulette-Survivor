# The Burn

##### Hedetet

- HAILFIRE and SHARDFALL - Hide behind a crystal
  - It then blows when hit
- DISSONANCE - Stack up on boss inside circle
- SHARDSTIRKE - Don't let this hit a crystal

##### Defective Drone

- When boss leaves the arena, be in front of the drone that has electrical sparks
  - It will also have no markers above its head
- ROCK BITERS - more adds from the edge, don't be in front of them
  - They look like spinning saw blades

##### Mist Dragon

- FOG PLUME - Star AoE - the "lines" for the star come from the outer points
  - Those who get hit will be trapped in ice, break them out
- VAPORIZE - DON'T ATTACK BOSS during this phase, this will freeze you. Kill dragon head adds instead
- Watch for line AoE when boss leaves the arena and covers it in fog.
