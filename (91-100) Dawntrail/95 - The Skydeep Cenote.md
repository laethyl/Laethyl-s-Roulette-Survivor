# The Skydeep Cenote

##### Feather Ray

- Avoid little bubbles
- When big bubbles come, they will be moved by the current, THEN explode
- TROUBLE BUBBLES - Look away from players, you will shoot bubbles in front of you
- When your overhead timer expires, be looking away from everyone

##### Firearms

- MIRROR MANUEVER - Beam will shoot from boss, be reflected off a mirror, and explode a bubble
  - Stay out of beam's path, and be on the far end of the arena from the bubble

##### Maulskull

- Stay near center at al times, but avoid tankbuster
- STONECARVER - Boss will wreck half the room, then the other
- Stand very near large blue circles, they knockback.
  - The diagonals are easy, but line up on the centerline of the arena for the center circle and be ready for STONECARVER
