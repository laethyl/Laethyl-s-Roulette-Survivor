- Never be under floating add
- Be between adds from edge, they'll walk across

- Ghost will possess a teacup, which will then move and eventually explode
  - When two get possessed, just watch one and be at 90 degree from it

  - Same circles will remove it
- GHOSTDUSTER - Don't be a ghost during this
- FLESHBUSTER - Be a ghost during this
- Column AoEs will come from ghosts on the edge in the order they appear
