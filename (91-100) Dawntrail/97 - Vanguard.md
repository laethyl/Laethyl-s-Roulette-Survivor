# Vanguard

##### Vanguard Commander R8

- ENHANCED MOBILITY - Dodge to corners of arena when blade and boss's turn are in the same direction
  - Collapse to center when they don't
- Don't be in front of adds that charge across edges
- Hovering adds will telegraph large cricles on the ground, find the safe spots

##### Protector

- Don't touch barriers that spawn periodically

##### Zander the Snakeskinner

- SOULBANE SABER - Be behind boss, glowing line eventually becomes a half-room wide AoE
- In Phase 2, only one quadrant will be safe. Watch for SLITHERBANE FORE/REARGUARD, boss does his own half-room wide AoE
  - FOREGUARD is front of boss, REARGUARD is back
- SYNTHESLITHER - Boss moves to an edge, crash on him and be INSIDE of the curve of the telegraph
  - He does this again after the first
