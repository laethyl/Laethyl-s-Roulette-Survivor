# SMILETON (aka Smile-town!)

**Face**
-When you get hit by a face, you will need to get hit by the opposite one next time
-The arena-wide knockback that comes will take you one face over, so use that if needed

**Frameworker**
-LEAP FORWARD - boss will leap where arrows point, be far away
--eventually, the untargetable adds will also leap

**The Big Cheese**
-There are 2 conveyors, one on each side of the arena
--Bombs will spawn on each. More arrows dictate how fast they move. They explode at the same time but in different positions depending on how fast they are. Find one of the two safe zones.
--Mines will eventually spawn to take away one of the two safe zones.
-Healer will get a stackup
-LEFT/RIGHT DISASSEMBLER - column AoE from the boss's Left or Right
