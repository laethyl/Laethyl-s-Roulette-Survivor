# The Aetherfont

##### Lyngbakr

- TIDAL BREATH - Be close to the boss, this covers half the room
- BODY SLAM - Makes crystals, first medium then later large
- UPSWEEP - Crystals from BODY SLAM blow up, be well away
  - Large ones create huge circles, probably only one safe spot
    - Toward the end of the fight there will be large AND med. The Med's will blow first!

##### Arkas

- LIGHTNING LEAP - Circle AoE that leaves purple cracks. Stand in between them.
- Avoid ALL purple on the ground!

##### Octomammoth

- OCTOSTROKE - Find the one platform with no tentacles in front of it
- SALINE SPIT - Blue balls on platforms that explode. Be between platforms.
- TIDAL BREATH - Boss smokes a full half of the room. Check the flank marker and be behind boss.
- TELEKINESIS - Be on the platform not targetted by an orange tether / eventual red laser
- BREATHSTROKE: Combines OCTOSTROKE and TIDAL BREATH into a single attack, except the safe platform will have a single Tentacle that further reduces the safe area to stand.
