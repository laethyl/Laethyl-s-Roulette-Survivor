# Tower of Zot

##### Minduruva

- Bio, can be esuna'd
- Boss moves can start to come from markers. Try to stay near all markers and the boss
  - The boss "shoots" each move to the markers, so you can see which is coming. Blizz 3 (starburst AoE) is always first
  - Fire III - donut
  - Thunder III - small circles in cardinal directions slowly come from boss
  - Bio III - get behind the boss quick

##### Sanduruva

- Spawns red spheres, observe the pattern to find the eventual safe spot
  - getting hit will cause you to lose control of your character!
- MANUSYA STOP - All are frozen one by one and will eat a nuke
- MANUSYA CONFUSE - Get behind the clone that doesnt dance upon spawning - this clone will also have the debuffs from the fight

##### Cinduruva/The Magus Sisters

- Always focus Cinduruva
  - Boss will raise adds if they die
- Loads of dodgeable moves from each boss
