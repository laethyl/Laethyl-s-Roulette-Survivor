##### The Demon Tome

- Run behind the boss when it "closes" or die
  - Be past a set of tiles away from it on the other side, it will turn and hit with a knockback.

##### Byblos

- Kill book adds, drag the tether you get after to the boss
  - This breaks boss out of its immunity. Only one is needed

##### The Everliving Bibliotaph

- Stand in circles when they light up, number of lights indicates how many players are required
  - This happens three times, requiring an additional player each time
- Bait orange mark to the edge
