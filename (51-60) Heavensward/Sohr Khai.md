##### Chieftain Moglin

- When adds die, hit the corpses away
  - This knocks them out of range of raise

##### Poqhiraj

- CHARGE - Have your back to a wall
- QUASAR - Aim this away from walls, or they will break
- CLOUD CALL - Purple marker, drop this where a wall has already been destroyed

##### Hraesvelgr
