# The Qitana Ravel

- Glowing statues will spit out damage, hide behind walls

##### Lozatl

- Watch for glowing statue in the back, avoid that half of the arena
- Watch for glowing half of boss, avoid that half of the arena
  - These are simultaneous later

##### Batsquatch

- SOUNDWAVE - If there are any large stalactites, they will collapse toward the center

##### Eros

- When tethered, run away until tether is purple
- INHALE - After puddle, boss will kirby-suck everyone to its center, align yourself to avoid puddles
- HEAVING BREATH - Boss will then shove you to the opposite wall, again align yourself
  - You can use knockback immunity for this one
- CONFESSION OF FAITH - Boss's heads will glow, avoid their gaze
  - Or ignore the heads and be in front of boss if there is also a stackup marker, run to the sides if not
