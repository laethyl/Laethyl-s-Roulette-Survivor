# The Lost City of Amdapor

##### Trash

- Kill Mold Colonies or more adds spawn

##### Decaying Gourmand

- Kill it

##### Arioch

- Boss fixates player with highest stacks of Scale Flakes. Tank should stand in front of the Ranch Wamouras to get the debuff when the add dies
  - If the debuff falls off of everybody, boss goes immune
  - Simply pull a new add when the debuff needs refreshing

##### Diabolos

- You can open doors with matching symbol/color to avoid RUINOUS OMEN, but most groups skip this now. Simply top off the group's HP before it goes off
- Drop marker away from group
