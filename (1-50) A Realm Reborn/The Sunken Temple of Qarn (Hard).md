# The Sunken Temple of Qarn (Hard)

##### Damaged Adjudicator

- Kill body part with red orb
- Drop marker at the edge

##### Sabotender Emperatriz

- Hit boss when it "gathers needles", otherwise hit adds
- Switch to Sabotender Guardia when it spawns, or die
  - It tethers to boss making it largely immune, and it can then gather needles and wipe the group

##### Vicegerent to the Warden

- Avoid mummies that come from the edges (2x groups)
  - Letting them touch you gives a debuff, at 4x you lose control of your character
- Stun boss when it tethers to a player
- Dodge if boss faces you for an untelegraphed attack
